# Adversarial-Attack-On-YOLOv8

In this project, we aim to assess the potential risks and vulnerabilities of a state-of-the-art model (YOLOv8) in the task of Traffic Sign Detection. The model is initially trained on the Vietnamese Traffic Sign Dataset and subsequently subjected to attacks using FGSM and PGD. Finally, we propose an improved version of the model that demonstrates significant positive results.

This is the Final Project of the course Computer Security at HCMUS-APCS. Team members:
